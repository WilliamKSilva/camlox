# About

This is a code interpreter for the programming language "Lox".
This code is being writen following the languages Book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

The code for the first interpreter in the book was writen using Java, but since I'am
learning and messing around with Functional Programming lately, I decided to implement my own version of the interpreter using OCaml, trying to "port" the
Object Oriented Java code to Functional OCaml.

# Crafting Interpreters

The book is a huge introduction to how programming languages work under the hood,
explaining all the processes a Compiler do in order to translate raw source code to
something that we can parse and translate to machine code (Or bytecode ;D). The book was writen by Robert Nystrom, a Google engineer that works on the Dart programming language. Check out more about the book at [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
